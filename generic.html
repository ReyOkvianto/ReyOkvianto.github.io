								<p>My name is Reyandra Okvianto, but I prefer to go to by Rey. I grew up in Katy, Texas the majority of my life, and I am now a Junior attending Texas A&M University. I love learning and trying all new things! I try to see out adventures that can take me out of my comfort zone because I realize how much I can challenge myself mentally and physically. In my free time, I enjoy playing sports (spikeball, basketball, badminton, etc.), cooking creative meals, making music, and overall just spending quality time with friends & family. I also like to joke and laugh a lot because life is too short to always be serious.</p>
								<p>As an undergraduate Computer Engineering student, there has been many times where I ponder the possible career paths after college. Whether it be designing the hardware interface for a computer's core processor or consistently updating the databse of an online ecommerce business, I consider myself very blessed to be where I am in life and I am excited for what the future has to offer. I am very passionate about a lot of different things, but I have aspirations of developing software to make a difference in the world in any way that I can. I may be young and rather inexperienced, but my hard-work, dedication, and adaptability will help me overcome future obstacles and propel me towards success. I hope that whoever comes across this webpage, will be inspired to not only picture a way that they could make an impact in our world, but develop the confidence to create it.</p>
								<p>"If you do not challenge yourself, you will never realize what you can become." </p>
